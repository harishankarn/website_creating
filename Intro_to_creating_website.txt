                          CREATING AN OWN WEBSITE

 First find yourself a Domain and a hosting serivce. 

 A domain name is a string of text that maps to an alphanumeric 
 IPaddress, used to access a website from client software.
 
 Eg: Domain name for my website is harishankarn.in

 A hosting serivce helps use publish the website we created by
 saving it in there server. 
 
 The domain provider will redirect the user to the hosting server since the 
 domain provider only holds the domain name and not the contents of the
 website which is contained in the hosting server

 Some well knowing hosting services and Domain providers are :
 
 1. Godaddy - generally faster but more expensive
 2. Servage - less expensive and can host unlimited hosting servers but slow
 
 [Important Note : both are paid services]
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 This time we will use FTP "file transfer protocol" for the demonstartion
 
 We will use goddaddy to find a domain name and servage are our hosting 
 service.
 
 Step 1 :
 Find your desired hosting name from goddady and continue with there process 
 to get yourself that domain name
 
 Step 2 :
 Then go to servage then in websites, add you website
 
 Step 3 :
 once the website is added for to files and FTP. Here you will be able to see 
 your hostname.
 
 Step 4 :
 Click on ADD and type your usr/pass. You will see your user in the list
 
 Step 5 :
 Then click on edit. You will see a lost of folder made default by your
 hosting service provider. 
 
 Now you can create your website code and just add to the public html folder
 
 If you already have your code ready you can just move the code to the public 
 html folder already present in the servage listing.
 
 Step 6 :
 To move content you can either use terminal or a gui(filezilla)

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 (Terminal)
 Step 7 :
 
 Type : ftp [hostname]
 It will prompt for username and password.
 You can use "help" to learn the commands. Few basic ommands are -
 
    1. ls - list
    2. lcd - current location of local machine (Can also be used to navigate)
    3. delete - to delete file in remote server
    4. pwd - current location in remote machine
    5. cd - navigate in remote macine
    6. put - to copy one file
    
 Step 8:
 Use 'lcd' to navigate in local machine to the dir and use 'ls' to navigate
 in the remote machine. Once in the correct folders use 'put [filename]'. 
 This will copy the will to your hosting server
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 GUI alternative to manage folder in hosting service : Filezilla
 
 To install : sudo apt install Filezilla
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 (Filezilla)
 Step 7 :
 after opening filezilla type you host name, user name and the password you 
 set for that username. For port we can use the standard servage port of "21" 
 then quickconnect.
 
 Step 8 :
 Now navigate to folder in local site(left) and remote site(right) and drag 
 and drop from local to remote site and your files should copy
